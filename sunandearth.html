    <p> The earth is approximately 151.94 million kilometres away from the sun.
      The earth takes 365 days to fully go around the sun that is why a year has 365 days.
      Withput the sun we will not be able to survive thats why the sun is very important to us and plants. If plants do not get sunlight then will will not be able to photosynthesis and will not be able to make food for us therefore we will die. Mercury is the nearest to the sun then veus then earth.It is the earth's relationship to the sun, and the amount of light it receives, that is responsible for the seasons and biodiversity. The amount of sun a region receives depends on the tilt of the earth's axis and not its distance from the sun.The Earth rotates on its own axis and it is tilted at an angle of 23.5° with respect to its orbital plane; this causes the occurrence of seasons. The revolution of the Earth around the Sun, which requires 365 days and 6 hours, in an elliptical orbit also causes the change in seasons.
